### HEADS UP! 
It's important that before deployment you change the deploy script args to point toward an existing NFT contract on a network, or the example NFT supplied in this branch.

```bash
cd scaffold-eth
yarn deploy
```

✅ Try minting yourself a new NFT with the UI! What happens if you try to mint another one for the same tokenId?

⛎ Try to mint an NFT with a tokenId that isn't yours, does it still mint?
