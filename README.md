## About The Branch

This branch is entitled to showcase a particular usecase of [Bonding Curve](https://yos.io/2018/11/10/bonding-curves/) which makes use of the [Bancor's Bonding Curve Formula](https://yos.io/2018/11/10/bonding-curves/#mathematical-formula) & it is a upgraded version of this [branch](https://github.com/scaffold-eth/scaffold-eth/tree/bonding-curve)

## Introduction

**To Dive deep on an introduction to bonding curves, please check out this [branch](https://github.com/scaffold-eth/scaffold-eth/tree/bonding-curve) as the emoji feast (current branch) assumes the users having a basic understanding of bonding curves and bancor bonding curves spefically**

Basically the idea behind this branch is to gamify bonding curves by creating a price leaderboard for different emoji's, so more costly the emoji the higher it is ranked on the leaderboard.

The price is fetched from a smart contract method
```
function getPrice() external view returns (uint256)
```

which just returns the price of 1 ETH worth of the emoji token.

### Mechanism

During the deployment when the 6 emoji contract's get deployed there is small 0.0001 eth to set the reserve amount which is required as per the Bancor Formula and the reserve ratio which determines the price sensitivity is set to 30 % for all emoji's

Further on as user lock in eth in a particular emoji token contract they wish to mint and the price increases with the supply and vice-versa if the user burns the token.
